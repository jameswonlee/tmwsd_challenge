# About
Message Incinerator is a full-stack web application designed to provide secure and temporary message storage. Users can create, save, and view messages that self-destruct after a single view. Each message is encrypted to safeguard your data. The application also includes a dark mode/light mode toggle for improved usability, a countdown timer that indicates when a message will self-destruct, and a mobile-friendly interface for seamless use on any device.
